# Legatus
Legatus is an AES encryption supported chat room.\
It cannot do much for the time being and is just a basic chat app. Host the python flask server and set it's URL in the source code and then build. I suggest hosting it on replit and keeping it up with UptimeRobot if many people won't be using it. It can be further modified to work like a fully fledged chat app like WhatsApp or Telegram.
