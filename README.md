# Legatus
Legatus is a 1:1 live chat application.\
It cannot do much for now. Host the flask server and set the URL in the source code. Create two builds, in one set the user as "Questo" and in the other set the user as "Exclay". You can further make changes in the souurce code to have a custom encryption and decryption key/iv.\
Now the two builds should be able to have a live connection with each other. Currently, I've made this just as a practice project so if there are any improvements that can be made, please let me know.\
